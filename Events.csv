"The Dublin Jazz Co-op Presents Luisa Annibali","Event","Performing both in Ireland and Italy, with her original project she blends music from her native Italy with Brazilian tinges and contemporary jazz making ample room for her distinctive voice to shine through.

Her new tracks ‘My Own Paradise’ and ‘I Could Melt’ are a perfect example of her own personal take on jazz music, mixing feminist themes in her lyrics with contemporary jazz undertones reminiscent of artists such as Esperanza Spalding and Gretchen Parlato. The music feels fresh and cutting edge while never losing sight of its roots in the jazz standard repertoire.

"Patrick Feeney","Event","Patrick Feeney was born to sing and from the tender age of four he wanted to be on stage with his father who played in a local band.

Patrick’s phenomenal success over the past few years can be summed up in three words taken from the title of his first album back in 2003 – a title that says it all – Thanks to You. It’s 18 years since the then-teenager released that debut album and while he has recorded countless songs since, he still lives by the motto that it’s thanks to you – the fans – that he is such a success today.

Patrick has legions of fans across Ireland and is a regular guest on TV and Radio. A versatile performer, he is known nationally for his remarkable tenor voice and has won many prestigious awards over the years.","https://backstage.ie/events/patrick-feeney-2025/","https://backstage.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/1173656302","00353433347888","00353433347888","Backstage Theatre","Backstage Theatre, Farneyhoogan, Farranyoogan, Longford","Longford","53.7155877","-7.7996963","No","27","07/02/2025","07/02/2025",,,"No"

"The Scratch","Event","Musicians making the time-honoured leap from acoustic to electric are well-documented, but The Scratch did it the other way round. Bob Dylan famously received a hostile reaction when he went electric in 1965. When The Scratch went acoustic, they ushered in a new and exciting creative chapter. What's more, they signed to Sony Music Ireland and are on the same roster as Bob Dylan!

Prior to The Scratch, they were a ""a full-blown metal band"" called Red Enemy, who released an album and toured the UK and US. After Red Enemy fizzled out, four of its five members re-convened. ""We started looking at ways to express ourselves a bit more authentically,"" Conor Dockery says. ""Something we could put our individual personalities into.""","https://www.inec.ie/gigs/the-scratch/","https://www.ticketmaster.ie/the-scratch-tickets/artist/5263810","00353646671555","00353646671555","Gleneagle INEC Arena","Gleneagle INEC Arena, Muckross Rd, Poulnamuck, Killarney, Kerry","Kerry","52.04446599999999","-9.502486","No","34.65","20/12/2024","20/12/2024",,,"No"

"The Dutch Golden Age","Event","While the spiritual urgency of the Counter-Reformation church dominated the arts in Italy, an entirely distinct visual revolution was taking place north of the Alps. In the new Protestant context, the need for religious imagery had all but vanished in the wake of the Reformation. Artists such as Jan Steen, Rembrandt van Rijn, Johannes Vermeer, and many others, famously sought new subjects by appealing to the wishes of a new market. The religious altarpiece was supplanted by new subjects – landscape, still life, scenes of everyday life, and a reimagined approach to portraiture. Still loaded with symbols and hidden meanings, these new subjects capture a fascinating reflection of life in the Dutch Golden Age.

Presented by Dr Matthew Whyte.","https://triskelartscentre.ie/events/art-history-reframed-spring-lecture-series-2/","https://triskelarts.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/873650296","00353214272022","003532142720222","Triskel Arts Centre","Triskel Arts Centre, Tobin St, Centre, Cork","Cork","51.8973901","-8.4763464","No","25","25/03/2025","25/03/2025",,,"No"
"The Baroque in Italy: Sacred & Profane","Event","Discover the turmoil, tenacity, and triumphalism of the Counter Reformation in Baroque Rome in the 16th and 17th centuries, a time of radical innovation and considerable turmoil in the history of art. Artists such as Caravaggio and Gianlorenzo Bernini navigated the strict rules placed on art by the Council of Trent to restore the church’s legitimacy after the Reformation. In this context, stunningly beautiful and spiritually stirring sculpture and architecture became as familiar, relevant, and responsive to the environment as the scandalous and often violent imagery associated with Caravaggio, whose unprecedented style caused a sensation in painting which reverberated across Europe.

"Scrooged","Event","High-spirited high-jinks on Christmas Eve puts Frank Cross (Bill Murray) in a ghostly time warp in this hilarious take-off of Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol”. Cross, who has made the meteoric rise from the depths of the mailroom to TV network president, is mean, nasty, uncaring, unforgiving and has a sadistic sense of humour – perfect qualities for a modern day Scrooge. Before the night is over, he’ll be visited by a maniacal New York cab driver from the past, a present-day fairy who’s into pratfalls and finally, a ghoulish, seven-foot headless messenger from the future.

With these mysterious instructions, young Billy Peltzer takes possession of his cuddly new pet. He gets a whole lot more than he bargained for.

This event invites festival-goers to step into that bittersweet tradition, while embracing the lively spirit of Irish music and song.

"Monday Night Cinema: Black Dog","Event","The now desolate city is overrun with stray dogs, and Lang enlists in the team rounding them up as part of a pre-Beijing Olympics clean-up. When Lang captures the suspected rabid Black Dog (Xin), an unexpected bond forms between man and dog.

Director Guan Hu, better known for recent blockbuster The Eight Hundred, delivers a more delicate work with Black Dog. Drawing on elements of Western, film noir and comedy, and shooting in widescreen, Hu’s unlikely tale of redemption is unique, intimate, yet cinematic. But it’s actor Peng’s and faithful companion Xin’s winning performances that make this 2024’s must-see crowd pleaser.

Support on the night will come from the Dublin based composer, producer and multi-instrumentalist R.F Chaney who’s new album Tropism was released this November.

"Emma - An Abbey Theatre Production","Event","Centring on the charming, clever, flirtatious, and cunning title character, Emma follows the privileged lives and relationships of individuals from upper-class families in Georgian-Regency England. Skewering social norms of the day, it examines love, desire, class, and the effort it takes to sustain a life of luxury.

Ripping the bodice of tradition, Emma will thrill audiences with modern flourishes, a contemporary soundtrack and a period-but-playful retelling of the classic comedy of manners.  

Adapted by Kate Hamill, Emma is directed by Claire O’Reilly, a Resident Director at the Abbey Theatre in 2022.

Talking about what playing Whelan’s means to him, Luke said, ‘This gig will be a massive full circle moment for me as I played Whelan’s main room in 2017 for what was my third ever headline show, and it was one of the best gigs that I’ve ever played. I feel like I’ve always been trying to top that night, and maybe I have in reality, but in my head it’s still up there as unbeatable.

"Midwinter Festival: RAVEL","Festival","This January we celebrate 150 years since the birth of Maurice Ravel, one of the most original and sophisticated composers of the twentieth century. Our Midwinter Festival presents a wide-ranging survey of his solo piano, chamber and vocal music, as well as a new choreography of his world-famous Boléro, in partnership with Galway Dance.

"The Darkest Hour","Event","As we sit together on the brink of the longest night, we’ll lean into the depths of Irish mythology to uncover the wisdom within the shadows. Through powerful stories and evocative live music, experience how our ancestors found strength in hardship and learned to survive—and even thrive—by embracing the darkness. Join us as we explore the magic of myth. The collective creations, inspirations, evocations and sensorial stimulations these tales evoke. They inspire resilience, spark the spirit, and remind us that spring always returns.

"Eliades Ochoa - Star of Buena Vista Social Club","Event","Ochoa is well known and loved worldwide as one of the original members of Buena Vista Social Club, having famously lent his vocals to that album’s iconic opener ‘Chan Chan’. The rugged features, the signature hat, the cowboy boots and the iconic ‘man in black’ image. The songs from the school of life imbued with the sort of hard - earned, country - tinged wisdom that can’t be bought.

You don’t have to look or listen too hard to understand why Eliades Ochoa is often called ‘Cuba’s Johnny Cash’. Yet if parallels abound, his latest album Guajiro also shows him to be a singular voice with his own unique style and sound, rooted deep in Cuban tradition but with an appeal that is as timeless as it is universal.

They have released music on Sleazy Records (Spain) and Migraine Records (Germany), appeared multiple times on Radio 4’s Loose Ends, and had their music played by everyone from Marc Riley to Huey Morgan.

The band have constantly added new flavours to their sound: Heron in particular is a vinyl obsessive, always fired up about some new passion – calypso or boogaloo or whatever this week brings – but mostly enthusing about obscure blues and country 45s, and that eclecticism and search for new sounds certainly feeds into their songs.","https://www.tseac.ie/events","https://tseac.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/873650525","0035318020898","0035318020898","The Séamus Ennis Arts Centre","Main St, Naul Village, Naul, Dublin","Dublin","53.5861164","-6.2896923","No","20","05/04/2025","05/04/2025",,,"No"
"Lisa Lambe","Event","‘Nightvisiting’ reconnects us to the social role that night time social house visits once played in our oral traditions and folklore, and in the preservation of our songs and stories from tender love songs, to songs of loss and longing. In the West, ‘Nightvisiting’ is known as ‘Bothántaíocht’ or ‘Cuairtaíocht’, in West Cork and Kerry, it is known as going ‘Scoraíochting’. In other counties; a visit to the Rambling House. 

‘Nightvisiting’ will bring you, to the hearth of the rural house, to sing the old songs and tell the local stories, many now lost or forgotten.

"Record of a Tenement Gentleman","Event","In RECORD OF A TENEMENT GENTLEMAN, Ozu’s first film after the Second World War, a homeless boy wanders the streets of a deprived neighbourhood of Tokyo in post-war Japan, where nobody wants to take care of him. After a draw, he is entrusted to Tane, a grumpy middle-aged widow who is allergic to children. Forced to take him in, she gradually grows fond of him. This marvellous, bittersweet neorealist chronicle is tinged with burlesque and comic touches, and exemplifies the singularity and poetry of Ozu’s work, simple yet powerful, made with modesty and restraint.

"The Art of the Enlightenment","Event","1,300 years after the fall of the Roman Empire, and more than 2,000 years since the Golden Age of Ancient Greece, the visual forms of the Classical world found a renewed and direct relevance in a new intellectual context – the Enlightenment. In the most vigorous Classical revival since the Renaissance, and indeed in an even more direct manner, Europe saw a resurgence of interest in the art of Ancient Greece and Rome which changed the visual fabric of the world – from the Court House in Cork to the White House in Washington DC, we continue to see the impact of this time. Far from merely an aesthetic interest, though, Enlightenment thinkers adopted the Classical Ideal as a solution to the myriad problems the Enlightenment sought to address.","https://triskelartscentre.ie/events/art-history-reframed-spring-lecture-series-4/","https://triskelarts.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/873650296","00353214272022","00353214272022","Triskel Arts Centre","Triskel Arts Centre, Tobin St, Centre, Cork","Cork","51.8973901","-8.4763464","No","25","08/04/2025","08/04/2025",,,"No"

"Canova in Cork: Our Collection & Artists","Event","In 1818, a vast collection of plaster casts departed the studio of famed sculptor Antonio Canova in Rome, destined for the Prince Regent of England George Augustus Frederick (later King George IV, reg. 1820-30). A gift of political significance, this collection, with the help of happenstance, was presented to Lord Listowel, President of the Cork Society of Arts. For two hundred years, these casts have been on display to the public. Their history tells a story beginning in the Napoleonic Wars, linking to the political situation between Ireland and England, as well as the culture surrounding art, collecting, and even the relationship with the human body in Ireland in the Age of Enlightenment.

"Romanticism & the Triumph of Spirit","Event","In the wake of the Enlightenment’s efforts to revolutionise human civilisation through the championing of reason and rationality, there emerged a movement for whom the Enlightenment had neglected a key aspect of human experience: the spirit. In response, artists, musicians, poets, writers, and thinkers ushered in the movement we now know as Romanticism, which sought to explore those aspects of the condition that could not be known through the exercise of reason or the pursuit of science, creating some of the most famously stirring, beautiful, and evocative works of art, music, and literature ever created.","https://triskelartscentre.ie/events/art-history-reframed-spring-lecture-series-5/","https://triskelarts.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/873650296","00353214272022","00353214272022","Triskel Arts Centre","Triskel Arts Centre, Tobin St, Centre, Cork","Cork","51.8973901","-8.4763464","No","25","15/04/2025","15/04/2025",,,"No"

"35 Years of Art | Celebrating Gerard Byrne","Event","Of Byrne's first solo exhibition in ‘89, The George Gallery Director Susan Stairs wrote, “Gerard Byrne is a dedicated, prolific and exceptionally talented artist. This exhibition is, therefore, a stimulating and profound beginning to what will be a long and significant career.”

This exhibition includes recent paintings that represent the culmination of 35 years in painting: vibrant plein air, dynamic botanical and figurative works, iconic Irish seascapes, and serene still-lifes.

Though Joyce lived most of his life outside of Ireland, Dublin would provide the backdrop for virtually all of his work.

"James Joyce Walking Tour","Event","The James Joyce Centre offers two public walking tours of the city based on Joyce’s life and work: Introducing Joyce's Dublin and Footsteps of Leopold Bloom.

Though Joyce lived most of his life outside of Ireland, Dublin would provide the backdrop for virtually all of his work. On a stroll around the inner city, our guide will explain the real-life inspiration behind some of Joyce’s most celebrated writing, demonstrating just how central the streetscape of the ‘Hibernian metropolis’ was to the author’s life and art. The tour visits such stops as Belvedere College, the Gresham Hotel, the James Joyce Statue, Davy Byrnes, and the National Library.

This is an excellent and fun introduction to Joyce in a bustling part of the city.","https://jamesjoyce.ie/events/walking-tours/","https://jamesjoyce.ie/book-a-walking-tour/","0035318788547","0035318788547","James Joyce Centre","35 N Great George's St, Rotunda, Dublin","Dublin","53.3541941","-6.259980499999998","No","20","29/02/2024","29/02/2024",,,"Yes"

"Donegal Town 550th","Event","In 2024, Donegal Town presents an exciting calendar of events celebrating the town's 550th Anniversary.

Its origins can be traced back to 1474, when Lady Nuala O'Donnell established a Franciscan Abbey on the shores of Donegal Bay. Around the same time, her husband Red Hugh O'Donnell the First, Lord of Tir Chonaill founded Donegal Castle. The Town of Donegal grew up around these two great buildings and became the capital of Tir Chonaill. 

Donegal Town is one of Ireland’s most historic places. Few Irish Towns have reached their 550th Birthday. Yet, Donegal is still young at heart, a vibrant place, endowed with a remarkable and unique heritage and culture.

"A Streetcar Named Desire","Event","Blanche Dubois depends on the kindness of strangers and is adrift in the modern world. When she unexpectedly arrives to stay with her estranged sister Stella in a boisterous, crowded corner of New Orleans, she brings with her a past that will threaten their future.

Her delusions of grandeur frustrate Stella’s crude, brutish husband Stanley. As he stalks closer to the truth, Blanche’s fragile sense of identity begins to crumble, until one violent act changes all of their lives for forever.

Following his “perfectly directed” (Irish Independent) production of Blue Thunder, Cathal Cleary directs Tennessee Williams’ masterpiece for Smock Alley this Christmas season.

"Dave Hause","Event","Dave Hause’s songs have always been rooted in tangible reality- of emotion, of environment, of circumstance.

Since releasing his debut album, Resolutions, in 2011, the Philadelphia-born songwriter has poured his whole heart, soul and life into his music. That’s no different on Drive It Like It’s Stolen, his sixth full-length. Its 10 songs overflow with Hause’s trademark urgency and passion, shimmering with a truth that reflects the harsh realities of life in this day and age, as well the intermittent jolts of joy that punctuate it. After all, his songs have always detailed his own personal traumas and triumphs within the setting of an unforgiving capitalist backdrop, tethering those personal experiences to ineluctable external forces.","https://triskelartscentre.ie/events/dave-hause/","https://triskelarts.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/873648755","00353214272022","00353214272022","Triskel Arts Centre","Triskel Arts Centre, Tobin St, Centre, Cork","Cork","51.8973901","-8.4763464","No","20","21/02/2025","21/02/2025",,,"No"

"A Christmas Carol","Event","A Christmas Carol is Aaron Monaghan and Bryan Burroughs’ playful, physical storytelling, stage adaptation of Charles Dickens’ much loved novella.

Devised straight from Dickens’ classic text, the two award-winning actors – dressed in snazzy suits – play all the characters at break-neck speed using an array of colourful hats, scarves and an Ikea coat-rack!

The famous cautionary tale tells the story miserly Ebenezer Scrooge as he is visited by ghosts who take him on a journey through his past, present and future on one fateful Christmas Eve.

This production is funny, slightly scary, utterly heart-warming and features a surprise special guest appearing as Tiny Tim…
